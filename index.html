        <li>I am a fitness enthusiast, I love working out every day and trying out new recipies in the kitchen.

        <li>Back in India, I completed my Bachelor's degree in <i>Information Science and Engineering</i>. This
            educational journey not only
            equipped me with technical skills but also nurtured my problem-solving abilities and analytical thinking.

        <li>During the initial phase of my career, I worked as a <i>Software Developer</i>
            in the healthcare sector(PHILIPS). For 2.5 years, contributing to the development of solutions
            that made a positive impact on the healthcare landscape. This experience allowed me to develop a keen sense
            of attention to detail, as precision is crucial in both coding and health-related matters.</li>
        <li>Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue my career into the realms of data analyst or data engineering, which is
            one
            of the reason Iam doing specilization in the field of Data analyst.</li>
